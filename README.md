## SMR Portal
**SMR Portal** is a web-based platform designed for the integrative analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and molecular quantitative trait locus (xQTL) summary statistics to identify genes associated with complex traits, including diseases, using the summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and HEIDI (Heterogeneity in Dependent Instruments) methods. It comprises three modules: **online SMR analysis**, **locus visualization**, and **SMR database**. It aims to facilitate the discovery of complex trait genes, to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying GWAS signals, and to enhance the accessibility of these gene-trait associations for the research community.


## Data security Statement
To ensure the security of your data, you must log in to submit your GWAS summary data for the online SMR analysis. If you have not yet registered, you can do so [here](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr_portal/signup). For those interested, a demo is available on the "Create a Task" interface.

Should you have any questions, suggestions, or encounter any issues, please reach out to us at statgenlab@westlake.edu.cn.
